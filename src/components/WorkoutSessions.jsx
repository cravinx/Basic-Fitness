        <h1>A PERFECT WORKOUT SESSION</h1>
        <p>
          A perfect workout session isn’t defined by how hard you push yourself,
          but by how effectively you prepare, train, and recover. By
          incorporating a balanced mix of warm-up, strength training, cardio,
          core work, and cool-down, you ensure that every part of your body
          benefits. Consistency is key—over time, these sessions will help you
          build strength, endurance, and overall fitness while preventing injury
          and burnout. <br />A perfect workout session isn’t just about lifting
          weights or running on a treadmill—it’s a well-rounded experience that
          incorporates key elements to maximize efficiency, ensure safety, and
          help you reach your fitness goals. Whether you're aiming for weight
          loss, muscle gain, or overall health improvement, structuring your
          workout correctly is essential.

            <h4>Squats</h4>
            <p>
              Squats are a fundamental lower-body exercise that targets the
              quadriceps, hamstrings, and glutes. By engaging your core and
              lower back, squats help improve strength and stability. Whether
              you're aiming for muscle growth, endurance, or toning, squats are
              a versatile exercise that can be easily modified with weights or
              variations like jump squats for added intensity.

            <h4>Push-Ups</h4>
            <p>
              Push-ups are a classic upper-body workout that strengthens the
              chest, shoulders, triceps, and core. This bodyweight exercise is
              perfect for building muscle endurance and promoting overall
              upper-body conditioning. Beginners can start with modified
              push-ups on their knees, while advanced users can challenge
              themselves with variations like diamond push-ups or clap push-ups.

            <h4>Plank</h4>
            <p>
              The plank is one of the best exercises for core strength and
              stability. By holding a straight-arm or forearm plank position,
              you engage not just your core but also your shoulders, back, and
              legs. Regular planking improves posture, balance, and can help
              reduce the risk of back pain by strengthening the lower back.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>Lunges</h4>
            <p>
              Lunges target the lower body, focusing on the quads, hamstrings,
              and glutes, while also improving balance and flexibility. This
              exercise is great for toning and strengthening the legs.
              Variations like reverse lunges or walking lunges can keep your
              routine fresh and challenging, and adding dumbbells can intensify
              the workout.
